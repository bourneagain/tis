I've seen much worse stories on the internet, but I still don't think the excuse of 'it's just the local culture' is enough of an excuse, to be honest - no more than racist remarks should be excused because people come from 'a certain generation.'I've already been threatened with legal action after posting a bad review about a double glazing company on the internet, so that doesn't worry me too much! A review is a review - by sharing your experiences you're only going to assist others in making their decision as to whether to part with their money and stay at that hostel. Your quite entitled to mention the incident in any review of the hostel and I think you should do so. She should also provide a written report with full details to the Egyptian tourist police and to the diplomatic representation of her country in Egypt. Agreed. Write the review and have your friend report that douchebag to the proper authorities. Sorry to hear about your friend, that sounds like a terrible experience.I would definitely write a review. Write a review on TravBuddy too Write a review, and when I visit Egypt, I might probably avoid visiting that place. I wouldn't visit Egypt solo either. The whole purpose of a review is to inform others what to expect at a destination.I am sure most of the female travellers here on TB would like to avoid situations like the one you describe, and you can help them.\"Local culture\", and our desire to experience that, is one of the underlying reasons why we all travel. Fortunately we still have a choice as to what parts of local culture we do want to experience. frankingsteins wrote:A close friend at the hostel I'm staying at in Egypt has been made to feel very uncomfortable by the attention of one member of staff (well, the owner - an old man), as today his usual 'friendly' flirting turned into a full attempt to kiss in an inappropriate way.

Please consider leaving immediately, no business is worth patronizing if you feel that anyone working there has allegedly acted inappropriately or if you feel committed a crime against you or a friend, though not stated in your post, if you made any statement contemplating the pursuit any type of legal (civil\/criminal) action I would strongly reiterate my opinion to leave for personal safety purposes.frankingsteins wrote:I'm wondering whether anyone thinks posting a negative review of the hostel to Hostelworld.com mentioning this would be a good idea to warn other female travellers, or if that would lead to problems?

I agree racist remarks should not be tolerated at all. Thanks for all the positive feedback! Googling for terms like \"Egypt sexual harrassment\" is pretty depressing, with one website even claiming that 98% of women who visit the country feel harrassed in some way (crazy!) I'm just glad it wasn't as bad as it could be. Definitely, this will have to be an idea to which travellers should be able to fathom when visiting Egypt. We once stayed at a place that the owner had gotten some bad reviews but he turned out to be a real nice guy. However I was with my bf and not a woman traveling alone. I think you should definitely mention the incident in your review. Especially women traveling need to be aware of a potential problem.Maybe it doesn't happen all the time but better a bad review than a chance of a worse incident in the future. Dear Dave, all Good Day to you ...Unfortunately I'm new in forums and just noticed your post. and wished to help on the spot. However I think you still in Egypt !!Before anything, I'm fully agree to make a review about this hostel, strengthen your situation if you (or your friend) have photos with this hostel. I have been a Couchsurfer for more than 2 years and sometimes we recommend a sort of hostels in Downtown that had been reviewed and recommended by others. I'd like to raise the name of this hostel so, if it's one of our recommended list, absolutely we will remove it at least, if not announce about your negative situation in our internal community to let other travelers in safe.Well.. I'll not justify (as being one of the Egyptians) because even if there are justifications, it doesn't give a meaning of acceptance, but could just minimize the risk as well as don't generalize the individual experience.I'd believe that negative experience always has louder voice as a mark than positive ones and so it leave a generalized negative impression which is not fully true or practical (Please don't understand me wrong, I'm definitely not saying that you're not saying the truth). for instances,; the mentioned situation happened in a hostel and suppose this hostel is in an area within Cairo, and the fact is that Cairo (even if it's the capital), it's not and can't represent the whole country Egypt to say harassment in Egypt. Moreover I have seen a previous discussion and found someone post a link to a statistical site representing the top 10 countries in crime and Egypt wasn't even in any top list.Yes it could be exist. The following questions are the 3 W.. Where, When, and Why.- Where: Not only in which city in Egypt but also extend in which area within the same city. For instance, Cairo wasn't so big touristic city (except for Pyramids) when compared to other cities and so local people don't use to see foreigners with their various cultures, behaviors, and way of wearing. Recently Cairo became not only touristic city but also a residential for many foreigners living, studying, and working in. As we are generally considered as conservative society, foreign behaviors for sometimes are unfortunately misunderstood. So being a foreigner in some area like \"Heliopolis\", \"New Cairo\"...etc. is normal even if you act according to your normal behavior because these areas are more modern, educated, and poverty almost minimal. However being in very local and old places (around just some of touristic places), people not educated well, poverty is more and so people are not aware enough of difference culture and could act in improper ways. Accordingly even if in same city it could be normal in some area and could be risky or even dangerous even for Egyptian themselves !! - When: Based on where you are, it give you more or less when you can go.. Some area you can stay even 24 hours other area become empty by 10 PM !!- Why: First, you should separate harassment with local women apart from foreign women. They are fully different situations so I'm talking now about with the foreign case. Both sides share why harassment could exist. The Egyptian side ( as per \"Where\") has a determined red line of how to define conservative (as well as defining harassment ). Once you exceed the red line so you're free and can accept whatever. As being conservative, your red line is higher than ours or have more space or gap between them. what you could consider normally, it could be exceeding to our red line. for example (but not so practical, just to explain) a foreign woman when wearing a short could be perceived that she's showy with improper intention. when she hug or kiss her boyfriend or husband or whoever in a romantic way in public area, it violate our conservative society. Adding to that the media and how local people see the foreign movies and compare the foreign relationships not to your defined red line But to our red line. All of these points could lead that some (minors) follow you.On the other side... foreigners don't understand these points and act normally according to their cultures and don't make attention to different society, could not respect without negative intention that lead generally to ensure the incorrect image perceived by local Egyptian through media. Moreover that some foreigners already act in improper behavior in some places so.....!!Remember that because of being conservative, our definition to \"harassment\" is fully different than yours and it's more strict. Harassment could even include just a sight or kind of flirting or admiring that the society may prohibit. So that you may hear or listen in the media that harassment (as a general topic) is very high however when precisely compared to others (on the kind of harassment behaviors) it's very low while this word mainly refer to physical harassment. It's very very very rare to reach to physical harassment when compared the whole country Egypt with others.Conclusion: There are some places in Egypt, women can stay on the beaches with bikini, topless or even more without any annoying however other places even if she wear like Egyptian, she may still face a flirting because of being a foreigner and blond Accordingly, by just following some tips, it'll erase most of troubles (if found), however deep understanding by both sides will remove the whole troubles from its root but it need for loooooooong time of mutual understanding Anyway, It doesn't mean to let you worry from Egypt even for solo travelers. There are a lot of them came and still coming for many times to our land. and to give you a secret hint. If you generally used your emotional intelligent (like screaming ) to stop who may follow you, you will get a heavy support from others and perhaps they gonna punch that man till almost being dead . True Egyptians are always proud of being true pharaohs and true men by protecting women from any scratch probably found I'll try to write about it in my blogs to be more clear for anyone searching for this subject. If you (Dave) still facing a trouble, just let me know Best Regards and safe travel Ehab Hamed Hi Ehab Hamed,I completely agree about negative experiences unfortunately being more loudly spoken about than positive ones. I have posted the review on the hostel site I booked with - I won't name the place here though - with an honest assessment.This sort of thing might be limited to tourist cities where a lot of foreign women are visiting, as you said, but by no means seems limited to Cairo - of the two women I got to know during my Egypt trip, both had experienced problems with hostel managers (in other words, 100% of them!)As well as the one I previously talked about in Cairo, I met someone in Luxor who stayed at a hostel where the manager kept knocking on her door at night when she was asleep and asking to come in. She switched hostels the next day - luckily, there are a few to choose from.Both of these hostels are very highly rated and at or near the top of lists when searching for accommodation. I'd be very wary about recommending Egypt for female solo travellers - I had an amazing time doing the DIY trip, getting lost at train stations and everything, but maybe booking a (more expensive) tour would be the safest option. put this in a review on hostelbookers.com \/hostelworld Salam Alekom Dave (Peace upon you)By the way, it's our greeting I'd really sorry to hear that at least on behalf of others, and that really let me interested so much to know about the name of these hostels. If you don't wanna on public, I wish if you PM me.I wanna mention to be caution. hostels are not like hotels. there r a big different, and so hostels around the whole world are not highly trusted and haven't high quality but at least it works hmm so far so good.Again. I'd believe that both sides are responsible for the general image. As you mentioned those hostel was rated high and rating as you know, is an average indicator between a lot of people are rating. So you may rate 0% however another 3 are rating 100% with total average 75% (same result if the 4 rate for 75%). which mean that even those staff was wonderful according to the other 3, it was so bad in your friend case, which may mean or refer that the improper behavior from this manager didn't come from nothing or an incidence, it could be because of the misunderstanding or whatever. Perhaps your friend was so friendly and warm in her friendly relation that let that man misunderstand it (refer to the red line). don't forget also that different Language and jargon are big barriers in the communication.What I'd ask for, is just to analyze both behaviors the local as well as the foreign from the 2 different perspectives and apply what Steven Covey Said in the 7 habits of highly effective people \"Seek to understand before to be understood\". Even in the incident you heard in Luxor, you haven't been involved and so can't know the other side idea (the hostel staff). she may be the responsible not him !! Finally the fire doesn't come from nothing but it needs for even a little spark. (specially if it near to gas)Anyway, Tourism don't reflect the clear image of its society. If you get in contact with the local community you may see the 180 degree different.. perhaps... and so I'd recommend you Couchsurfing. I'm not advertising but truly we're concerning much with cultural understanding than just normal traveling, get in contact with the local society by trusted local people. I'm not saying that we're the best but we're trying to be around the whole world. we had even hosted solo women in our homes and mostly they vouched for us.. That is the true society, the local society which I think we should use for measure, not the tourism one that may have some minor incidences or business need behind their irresponsible behavior...Again, to be effectively sorry on behalf of all, I'd need for the name of those hostels...RegardsEhab frankingsteins wrote:Thanks for all the positive feedback!

I'm just glad it wasn't as bad as it could be.I was going to say that happens alot, not that it exscuses what has happened to your friend. As everyone says write the review, so long as you are honest but not to 'brutal' or 'over the top' there should be no reason for any further legal action or anything like that. Just make sure you keep your own piece of mind and be aware of these things for the future, it isnt something to be taken lightly, but I wouldnt take it to heart (or your friend is possible) because these things happen. Last edited by MrD3071 (12-9-2010 8:49 AM) Well that harasser is also sort of victim (still doesn't justify the harassment). Egypt has been slowly sinking like Titanic for the last 30-40 years. The country has lot of potential - but shitty governance. About everything else but population growth has been stagnating. There is no real democracy (just look at the last elections), no real freedom of speech, poverty, unemployment, economy is F.U.B.A.R and corruption is rife. The only thing keeping the ship afloat is tourism and the Saudi money.People are feeling sick and frustrated because of that all and those with weak mind & morals vent out their frustration by making those suffer who they feel are weaker than them - in this case the women. They don't have the courage to vent out the frustration to the real source: the corrupt authorities & government because they would get beaten, arrested, raped, jailed etc. Dystopic situation also breeds moral degration.\"Finally the fire doesn't come from nothing but it needs for even a little spark\" And in many cases the only spark needed is that you happen to be a woman. You get harassed no matter how conservatively and inconspicuously you try to dress. I got many friends who live in Egypt or used to live there and I have heard from them that you get harassment there no matter how lightly or conservatively you dress. And I noticed that also when I visited Egypt myself. One reason why the sexual harassment is so bad in Egypt is because the problem is almost completely ignored - woman is always the blame - no matter how hard she would try to cover her body. The defenders of those pricks always find some excuse to put the blame on woman. Ignoring and underestimating the situation doesn't make the problem to go away. It's a very inappropriate behaviour and a condemnable one too.A complaint with the tourist police would have been appropriate.The tourist Police are very helpful and even pull up cheating taxi drivers.The best for any tourist with no local friend is to chose from the govt recognised list of renowned hostels.All said and done there are perverts everywhere and it is upon us to be wary of the people around.God protect us in our travels. All reviews must be done taken the personal experience. So post it so other girls can be aware of it soon rather than later.I travelled in Egypt with my husband and I was never bothered. I found the places I visited so full of energy. Men can be forward yes! but this is not only in Egypt. Everyone wants to chat with you I I def notice that. and not because I was on my own, I had my hubbie next to me at all times! Foreing girls travelling alone must be extra careful, dress modestly and avoid things like heavy makeup and fancy jewellry, these will atract the opposite sex anywhere! I travelled solo in Egypt and found the police in both sharm and Cairo very accommodating! I even went out at night on my own and didn't feel threatened! Maybe not advisable but I still did, common sense at the end of th day prevails, not criticising the girl who this thread is about though I'm just saying!! Write a review but please try to post a picture of the place as well maybe even their website or email address" }

I find the winters not so nice, especially Istanbul is horrible. People use mainly with coal ovens, so you have major smog everywhere. BUT, the nice thing is you have very small lines, unless you travel during New Year Season. the snow is mainly slush, I find it extremely cold and would not travel even to Greme now in March - I even find Antalya too cold at the moment, but most everybody disagrees with me. Bodrum is nice in December, Antalya was very nice last christmas and warm enough. Many sights are best visited when the sun is out obviously. Like Ephesus - it is a very large outdoor museum, so how much fun can it be when it is raining? I have travelled in Turkey in winter including December. Weather can vary as it is a large country with many mountain and sea regions. In general though it is winter, cold and often with rain or snow. Towns on Mediterranean such as Antalya may be a bit milder but even there I would not expect temperature above fifteen. I am going to Istanbul on Tuesday and forecast high for Wednesday is ten degrees and cloudy.Given a choice between June and December in Turkey, I would definitely choose June. I think anywhere in Europe would seem cold outside of summer to any one from Indonesia. I have moved this thread to the Europe section of the forum. thanks Dahling and Francis..following your suggestion i think i have to resechedule my visit until summer next year..i want to enjoy Turkey to the fullest and i don't mind the sunshine, is it really crowded in the summer? in most places it is, but if you dare to stay of the touristy pathways, there are some very nice beautiful places to discover. Have you considered maybe October? Or April\/May - it is not as crowded and hotels are still cheaper and it is not THAT hot, even in the coastal regions. I think it is the nicest time for sightseeing and it is not so crowded yet. Yes we were there in late Nov\/early Dec. Weather was variable. Rainy and grey in Istanbul. Cappadoccia was clear but cold (-5C in the mornings). Selkuk\/Ephesus was clear and ok weather. So it depends where in the country you go. Well, I'm currently reading a novel titled \"Snow\" about events in a city (Kars) in eastern Turkey. Nuff said. You can find perfect place to go to any time of the year. Turkey is amazing. There is a big NYE meetup in istanbul!! maybe you can attent it!hendro_liu wrote:I am planning to go to Turkey in December or June, mainly visiting some historical cities like Istanbul,Ephesus, Goreme, Bodrum etc. Has anyone been to Turkey in December?how's the winter in Turkey? is it bearable?i mean, i am from Indonesia, a tropical country that has never endured any snow or winter.Would it be fun travelling during the winter compared to the summer? I enjoyed Turkey in early January. Where I am from its still warmer vs their december vs my february. You will en joy your time. I agree that Turkey is great all year round. I enjoyed being here in winter. However, it is not ideal and given the choice in original post of December or June, I would definitely recommend June. I agree with Bettina about April\/May or October. I would try to avoid July\/August unless you like heat, crowds and high prices. I'm in Istanbul now and it's distinctly cool and damp this morning. I went in December and it was not so bad during the day, but temperature dropped sharply at night, and the day we went to Bursa it was below 0 C by the time the game kicked off at 8-45. thanks for all the info guys.. i have never been to a place with a temperature below 10 celcius. is it really cold that i have to wear winter clothing and apparel? i really want to go in December or even this June but unfortunately i have made another plan to Vietnam and Cambodia.@dennys and jasmine..sounds great You will def have to wear winter clothing. I am accustomed the cold and I have to wear sweatshirts and jeans in that type of weather. You will for sure have too. I would definitely be prepared in December for temperatures well below ten degrees. Below zero degrees at night in places like Cappadocia. You will almost certainly need warm clothes but not extreme cold gear unless you're going mountain climbing or skiing or the like.I'm there now and it's nine degrees. Unseasonably cool but what I would expect in Istanbul in December. Warm shoes that won't get wet in case of rain are also a must in close-to-freezing temperatures. I suggest a hat as well - it's small to pack and can make a big difference in cold weather. I'm going next month during Thai new Year (13-20). I do hope the temp will be above 10. :-)" }
